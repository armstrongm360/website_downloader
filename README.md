# website_downloader
A python script that downloads websites as HTML files so you can save it and open it on your own computer.

When you run this python script, it will ask you to input the URL to download and what file directory you want to save in. Once a link is found, it will follow through to the next page (only within the same website) and download it. It will do this only 3 times to keep it from downloading too much. If you want to change this, you can on line 111 of the script.
